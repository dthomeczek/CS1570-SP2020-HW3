# Homework #3

This was the second coding assignment for Spring 2020's CS1570 course taught by professor Clayton Price. The problem is centered around the character Groundskeeper Willy from The Simpsons. We were limited to using only what we had been taught up to this point in the course to complete the assignment.

# README Details From The Assignment:

You should only have a single C++ compilable file containing a program written in C++.

# Input Order

Make sure you follow the instructions on how to prompt for inputs very carefully so our grading script can run correctly.

Instructions from the assignment page:

  - input only if you need the information.
  - if you need to know if the number of children present is less than the number of adults, you must first input the number of children, then the number of adults, and the use math....like subtraction.
  - to know if Chalmers is present, prompt for and input 'y' or 'n', a character to determine this factoid.
  - prompt for and input the inches of rain, even if you only need to know whether or not it rained.  If you need to know both rain and gas, prompt for rain first.  note: zero inches of rain means it didn't rain.
  - prompt for and input the number of gallons of gas if needed.
